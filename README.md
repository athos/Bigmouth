Bigmouth is a Clojure framework to build delivery-only Mastodon-compatible web apps.

**Note**: Bigmouth is currently still in alpha quality and so not really suited for production use.

## Install

Add the following line to your `:dependencies`:

[![Clojars Project](https://clojars.org/bigmouth/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/bigmouth)

Make sure you have JVM 1.8.0 or later to run your Bigmouth app since Bigmouth is using a couple of the features introduced in JVM 1.8.
